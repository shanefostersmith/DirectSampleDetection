# DirectSampleDetection
Ever wondered how a song was directly sampled in another song? Or if one song directly used someone else's work w/o clearance? When inputted two audio files, one of which is a song w/ a sample, and the other is that sample song, this program will detect how section(s) of the sampled song where inputted into the other song. See instructions below.
